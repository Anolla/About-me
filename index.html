     Hello visitors,
     
     My name is Anolla Haddad ( my name means Mercy/Grace of God, if I get a dollar for everytime someone asks me this question, I will be a millionaire by now!).
     Born and raised in Amman-Jordan, I studied Surveying and Geomatics Engineering at Al Balqa Applied University and graduated in february 2019.
     I worked at a GIS company as an Analyst for almost 6 months, then I worked as an Executive Contact Center for two months.
     My ultimate goal is always to be the best version of my slef by getting better day by day.
